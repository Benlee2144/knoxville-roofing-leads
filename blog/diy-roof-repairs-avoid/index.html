        <h1>DIY Roof Repairs: What to Try vs What to Avoid</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 5 min read</p>

        <p>YouTube makes everything look easy. But roofing is one area where DIY can quickly go wrong – either making the problem worse, voiding your warranty, or putting you in the ER.</p>

        <p>Let me help you figure out what's reasonable to tackle yourself and what needs a professional.</p>

        <h2>What You Probably CAN Do</h2>

        <div class="ok-box">
            <p>These are generally safe for DIY if you're reasonably handy and comfortable with heights:</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Cleaning Gutters</h3>
        <p>Pretty straightforward. Use a sturdy ladder, have someone spot you, wear gloves. Don't overreach – move the ladder. Most homeowners can handle this.</p>

        <h3>Removing Debris</h3>
        <p>Branches, leaves, and debris that pile up on your roof should be cleared. You can do this with a roof rake from the ground or carefully with a broom if you need to be on the roof.</p>

        <h3>Minor Caulking</h3>
        <p>Sealing small gaps around vent boots or flashing with roofing caulk is basic maintenance. Just don't mistake "slather caulk on everything" for actual repair.</p>

        <h3>Replacing a Single Shingle</h3>
        <p>If you've got one damaged shingle and access to matching replacements, this is doable. The process: lift the shingle above, pull nails, slide new shingle in, nail it, seal the nail heads. YouTube can show you the technique.</p>

        <h3>Clearing Ice Dams</h3>
        <p>Using calcium chloride (not rock salt) to melt channels through ice dams. You can do this without climbing on the roof.</p>

        <h2>What You Should AVOID</h2>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p>These tasks carry real risk of making things worse or getting hurt:</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Working on Steep Roofs</h3>
        <p>Anything above a 6/12 pitch (about 26 degrees) is dangerous without proper equipment. Professional roofers use roof jacks, harnesses, and have experience with the footing. You probably don't.</p>

        <p>Falls from roofs are the leading cause of construction fatalities. This isn't worth dying over.</p>

        <h3>Flashing Repair</h3>
        <p>Flashing looks simple but isn't. Improper flashing repair often makes leaks worse by directing water somewhere it wasn't going before. And the leak might not show up until the next heavy rain – by then you think you fixed it.</p>

        <h3>Any Structural Work</h3>
        <p>If you see rotted decking, sagging rafters, or structural damage – stop. This requires actual expertise. Doing it wrong can compromise your roof's integrity or even cause collapse.</p>

        <h3>Full Shingle Replacement</h3>
        <p>One shingle? Okay. A whole section or roof? That's not DIY territory. The layering, nailing patterns, and integration with existing shingles is more complex than it looks. Plus, most manufacturer warranties require professional installation.</p>

        <h3>Anything When It's Wet or Icy</h3>
        <p>Roofs are slick when wet. Even a low-slope roof becomes dangerous. Wait for dry conditions.</p>

        <h3>Work Near Power Lines</h3>
        <p>Overhead power lines near your roof are deadly. Professional roofers know how to work around them. Homeowners have died touching or getting too close to lines they didn't even see.</p>

        <h2>The Hidden Cost of DIY Mistakes</h2>

        <p>Beyond physical danger, DIY roof work can cost you in other ways:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voided warranties:</strong> Most manufacturer warranties require professional installation. DIY work can void coverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance issues:</strong> If your DIY repair fails and causes damage, insurance may not cover it.</li>
            <li><strong>Making it worse:</strong> Improper repairs often cause more damage than the original problem. I've seen $300 repairs turn into $3,000 fixes because of bad DIY.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden damage:</strong> What looks like a simple shingle issue might reveal deck rot or other problems. Are you prepared to handle what you find?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>If You Do Go Up There</h2>

        <p>Some tips if you decide to do minor roof work:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tell someone.</strong> Have another person aware you're on the roof.</li>
            <li><strong>Use proper footwear.</strong> Soft-soled shoes with good grip. No flip-flops, no hard soles.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure your ladder.</strong> Set it on level ground, extend 3 feet above the edge, tie it off if possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay back from edges.</strong> Most falls happen at roof edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Work in good conditions.</strong> Dry, calm, not too hot or cold.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't work alone.</strong> At minimum, have someone check on you regularly.</li>
            <li><strong>Know your limits.</strong> If it feels sketchy, come down. Pride isn't worth a broken neck.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to Just Call</h2>

        <p>Here's my advice: if you're watching YouTube to figure out how to do it, you should probably call a pro.</p>

        <p>Roofers do this every day. What takes you 4 hours takes them 45 minutes. They have the equipment, the insurance, and the experience to do it right the first time.</p>

        <p>The cost of a professional repair is almost always less than the cost of a DIY mistake.</p>
