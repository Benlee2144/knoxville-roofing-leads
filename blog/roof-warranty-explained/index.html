        <h1>Roof Warranties Explained: What's Actually Covered</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 6 min read</p>

        <p>"Lifetime warranty" sounds great. But what does it actually mean? In roofing, warranty language is confusing, and what seems like solid coverage might have big gaps. Let me break it down.</p>

        <h2>Two Types of Warranties</h2>

        <p>When you get a new roof, you're dealing with two separate warranties:</p>

        <h3>1. Manufacturer Warranty</h3>
        <p>This covers defects in the roofing materials themselves – shingles that crack prematurely, manufacturing flaws, that kind of thing. It does NOT cover installation problems.</p>

        <h3>2. Workmanship Warranty</h3>
        <p>This is from your contractor. It covers problems with how the roof was installed – improper nailing, bad flashing work, missed details. If the shingles are fine but the installation was botched, this is what covers you.</p>

        <p>You need both. A great shingle installed badly will fail. A perfect installation with defective materials will fail. Most roof problems in the first 10 years are installation-related.</p>

        <h2>What "Lifetime" Actually Means</h2>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Reality check:</strong> "Lifetime warranty" doesn't mean what most people think. In roofing, "lifetime" typically means "as long as the original purchaser owns the home" – and it's usually prorated after the first 10-15 years.
        </div>

        <p>Here's how prorating works: Say you have a "50-year" warranty and something fails in year 30. You've used 60% of the warranty period, so the manufacturer might only cover 40% of replacement costs. By year 40, coverage might be minimal.</p>

        <p>Read the fine print. The headline warranty period is marketing. The actual coverage schedule tells you what you're really getting.</p>

        <h2>What's Usually Covered</h2>

        <h3>Under Manufacturer Warranty:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing defects</li>
            <li>Premature deterioration under normal conditions</li>
            <li>Algae resistance failure (on algae-resistant shingles)</li>
            <li>Wind damage up to rated wind speed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Under Workmanship Warranty:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaks caused by improper installation</li>
            <li>Flashing failures due to poor work</li>
            <li>Improperly sealed penetrations</li>
            <li>Issues from incorrect nailing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's Usually NOT Covered</h2>

        <p>Here's where people get surprised:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storm damage:</strong> That's an insurance claim, not warranty</li>
            <li><strong>Normal wear and tear:</strong> Shingles aging over time isn't a defect</li>
            <li><strong>Foot traffic damage:</strong> You walked on it or someone did</li>
            <li><strong>Acts of nature:</strong> Falling trees, extreme weather beyond rated specs</li>
            <li><strong>Improper ventilation:</strong> If your attic isn't properly ventilated and that damages shingles, warranty voided</li>
            <li><strong>Color fading:</strong> Usually excluded</li>
            <li><strong>Consequential damage:</strong> If the roof fails and ruins your furniture, that's not covered</li>
            <li><strong>Labor costs (often):</strong> Many manufacturer warranties cover only materials, not the labor to install them</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ways Warranties Get Voided</h2>

        <p>Be careful – doing any of these can void your coverage:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>DIY repairs:</strong> Having someone other than a qualified roofer work on your roof</li>
            <li><strong>Improper additions:</strong> Installing solar panels, antennas, or satellite dishes incorrectly</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure washing:</strong> Can damage shingles and void warranty</li>
            <li><strong>Inadequate ventilation:</strong> If inspectors determine ventilation was inadequate</li>
            <li><strong>Not registering:</strong> Some warranties require registration within a certain period</li>
            <li><strong>Selling the home:</strong> Some warranties don't transfer, or coverage reduces</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Enhanced Warranties</h2>

        <p>Manufacturer warranties can often be upgraded. When your contractor is certified by the manufacturer (GAF Master Elite, Owens Corning Preferred, etc.), you may qualify for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-prorated coverage:</strong> Full coverage for longer periods</li>
            <li><strong>Labor included:</strong> Manufacturer covers installation costs on claims</li>
            <li><strong>Transferable coverage:</strong> Warranty follows the roof to new owners</li>
            <li><strong>Extended coverage:</strong> Longer warranty periods</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These enhanced warranties sometimes cost extra, but they're often worth it for the better protection.</p>

        <h2>Questions to Ask Your Contractor</h2>

        <p>Before signing, get clear answers:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What exactly does your workmanship warranty cover?</li>
            <li>How long is the workmanship warranty?</li>
            <li>Is the manufacturer warranty prorated? When does proration start?</li>
            <li>Does the warranty transfer if I sell the house?</li>
            <li>What would void either warranty?</li>
            <li>Are you certified by the manufacturer for enhanced warranties?</li>
            <li>Can I see sample warranty documents before we sign?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Keep Your Documentation</h2>

        <p>Years from now, if you have a problem, you'll need:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Contractor's written warranty</li>
            <li>Manufacturer warranty certificate</li>
            <li>Proof of purchase (contract, receipt)</li>
            <li>Material specifications (what was installed)</li>
            <li>Date of installation</li>
            <li>Registration confirmation (if applicable)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Put these somewhere you'll find them. A lot of warranty claims get denied simply because people can't prove what was installed or when.</p>

        <h2>What Actually Matters</h2>

        <p>Here's my honest take: warranty length is less important than people think. What matters more is:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Quality materials:</strong> Premium shingles rarely fail within warranty anyway</li>
            <li><strong>Quality installation:</strong> Most problems are installation-related</li>
            <li><strong>Contractor reputation:</strong> A warranty from a fly-by-night company is worthless</li>
            <li><strong>Workmanship warranty length:</strong> This matters more than the manufacturer warranty</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A 5-year workmanship warranty from a reputable local company is worth more than a "lifetime" warranty from someone you can't find next year.</p>
