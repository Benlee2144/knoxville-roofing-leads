        <h1>How to File a Roof Insurance Claim After Storm Damage</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 10 min read</p>

        <p>So a storm just rolled through Knoxville and you think your roof took a beating. Maybe you heard the hail hitting. Maybe you noticed missing shingles. Maybe you've got water dripping into your living room.</p>

        <p>First: don't panic. Second: don't wait. Here's exactly what to do, step by step, to get your insurance to pay for the damage.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Document Everything Right Now</h2>

        <p>Before you do anything else, grab your phone and take pictures. Lots of them. I mean it – go overboard here.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Photos of your whole roof from the ground (multiple angles)</li>
            <li>Close-ups of any visible damage</li>
            <li>Pictures of hail on the ground if it's still there</li>
            <li>Interior damage – water stains, drips, wet insulation</li>
            <li>Damage to gutters, siding, windows, anything else</li>
            <li>Date and timestamp on your phone settings should be on</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Why does this matter? Insurance adjusters might not show up for a week or two. By then, some evidence is gone. Those hailstones melted. That standing water dried up. Your photos prove what happened when it happened.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Prevent Further Damage</h2>

        <p>Your insurance policy requires you to take reasonable steps to prevent additional damage. If you've got a hole in your roof and rain's coming, you need to cover it.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Quick fix:</strong> A blue tarp secured with boards or sandbags works temporarily. Don't nail through the tarp into your roof – that causes more damage. Most roofers offer emergency tarping services. Need detailed instructions? See our <a href="/blog/emergency-roof-tarp/">guide to emergency tarping a roof</a>.
        </div>

        <p>Keep receipts for any emergency repairs or materials. Insurance should reimburse these as part of your claim.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Call Your Insurance Company</h2>

        <p>Report the claim as soon as possible. Most policies require "prompt" notification – don't wait weeks. Call the claims number on your insurance card or app.</p>

        <p>What they'll ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Date and time of the storm</li>
            <li>Description of damage</li>
            <li>Whether anyone was injured</li>
            <li>Your policy number</li>
            <li>Contact information for scheduling the adjuster</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Get a claim number before you hang up. Write down the name of who you talked to. You'll need this later.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Get a Roofing Contractor to Inspect</h2>

        <p>Here's where a lot of people make a mistake: they wait for the insurance adjuster before getting their own inspection. Don't do that.</p>

        <p>Get a reputable local roofer to inspect your roof BEFORE the adjuster comes. Most offer free storm damage inspections. Here's why this matters:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Roofers know what to look for (adjusters aren't always roofing experts)</li>
            <li>They can document damage the adjuster might miss</li>
            <li>Their estimate gives you a baseline for negotiations</li>
            <li>They can be present during the adjuster's inspection</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Watch out for storm chasers.</strong> After big storms, out-of-town contractors swarm Knoxville offering "free" inspections. Some are legit. Many aren't. They do shoddy work, take your insurance check, and disappear. Stick with established local companies you can verify.
        </div>

        <h2>Step 5: The Adjuster Visit</h2>

        <p>The insurance company will send an adjuster to inspect your roof. This is a big deal – their assessment determines what you get paid. Here's how to handle it:</p>

        <h3>Be There</h3>
        <p>Don't just let the adjuster wander around alone. Be present. If you have a roofer you trust, ask them to be there too. Two sets of eyes are better than one.</p>

        <h3>Show Your Documentation</h3>
        <p>Share those photos you took right after the storm. Point out all the damage you've noticed. Don't assume they'll find everything.</p>

        <h3>Ask Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"Did you check [specific area]?"</li>
            <li>"How are you documenting the granule loss?"</li>
            <li>"Are you including the cost of removing the old roof?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Get Their Report</h3>
        <p>Ask when you'll receive the written estimate. Review it carefully when it arrives. Adjusters make mistakes. Things get missed.</p>

        <h2>Step 6: Understand Your Settlement</h2>

        <p>Insurance payouts for roof claims usually work like this:</p>

        <p><strong>ACV vs. RCV policies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Actual Cash Value (ACV):</strong> They pay the depreciated value of your roof. If your 15-year-old roof had a 25-year lifespan, they only pay 40% of replacement cost. Ouch.</li>
            <li><strong>Replacement Cost Value (RCV):</strong> They pay to replace your roof with equivalent materials. Way better. Check which you have.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Deductibles:</strong> Your out-of-pocket amount before insurance kicks in. In Tennessee, many policies have separate wind/hail deductibles – often 1-2% of your home's insured value. On a $300,000 home, that's $3,000-6,000.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Red flag:</strong> Any contractor who offers to "cover your deductible" or "work with your insurance" to waive it is committing insurance fraud. It's illegal and could void your claim. Legitimate contractors don't do this.
        </div>

        <h2>Step 7: If You Disagree With the Estimate</h2>

        <p>Adjusters lowball claims. It happens. If their estimate seems too low:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Get competing estimates</strong> from local roofers. If three contractors say the job costs $15,000 and insurance offered $9,000, you have leverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Document what's missing.</strong> Maybe they didn't include removing the old roof. Or they used prices from 2020 instead of current material costs. Specifics matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Request a re-inspection.</strong> Ask for a different adjuster to take another look. Bring your contractor.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider a public adjuster.</strong> These are independent adjusters who work for you, not the insurance company. They take a cut (usually 10-15%) but often increase settlements significantly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline Expectations</h2>

        <p>Here's roughly what to expect in Tennessee:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjuster visit:</strong> Usually within 1-3 weeks of filing</li>
            <li><strong>Initial estimate:</strong> A few days after the inspection</li>
            <li><strong>Payment:</strong> If approved, typically 2-4 weeks after agreement</li>
            <li><strong>Supplemental claims:</strong> Can add 2-4 weeks if issues are found during repairs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Reasons Claims Get Denied</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-existing damage:</strong> Insurance covers sudden storm damage, not gradual wear. If your roof was already failing, they might deny the claim.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance issues:</strong> Clogged gutters that caused water backup? That's on you, not the storm.</li>
            <li><strong>Filing too late:</strong> Most policies require claims within a certain period. Don't wait months.</li>
            <li><strong>Cosmetic damage only:</strong> Some policies exclude damage that doesn't affect the roof's function.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Advice</h2>

        <p>Dealing with insurance claims is frustrating. It's slow. It feels adversarial. But don't let that frustration push you into bad decisions.</p>

        <p>Take your time. Document everything. Get multiple opinions. Don't sign anything until you understand it. And choose a contractor based on their reputation and quality, not just whoever shows up first offering to "handle everything."</p>

        <p>Your roof is too important to rush this.</p>
