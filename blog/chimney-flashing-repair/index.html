        <h1>Chimney Flashing Repair: What You Need to Know</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 5 min read</p>

        <p>If your roof leaks near the chimney, there's about an 80% chance the flashing is the problem. It's one of the most common – and most commonly botched – roof repairs.</p>

        <h2>What Is Chimney Flashing?</h2>

        <p>Flashing is the weatherproofing system where your chimney meets your roof. It's made up of several pieces of metal that work together to direct water away from this vulnerable intersection.</p>

        <p>A proper chimney flashing system includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step flashing:</strong> L-shaped pieces woven into the shingles along the sides</li>
            <li><strong>Counter flashing:</strong> Metal embedded in the chimney mortar that overlaps the step flashing</li>
            <li><strong>Base flashing:</strong> At the bottom where the chimney meets the roof</li>
            <li><strong>Saddle/cricket:</strong> A ridge behind the chimney that diverts water around it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why It Fails</h2>

        <h3>Age and Weather</h3>
        <p>Metal expands and contracts with temperature changes. Sealants dry out. After 15-20 years, even good flashing starts to deteriorate.</p>

        <h3>Poor Initial Installation</h3>
        <p>A lot of flashing problems trace back to bad installation. Shortcuts like using only caulk instead of proper counter flashing, or not installing a cricket behind large chimneys.</p>

        <h3>Chimney Movement</h3>
        <p>Chimneys can shift slightly over time, separate from the house structure, or develop cracks. This movement breaks seals and creates gaps.</p>

        <h3>Roof Replacement Without Reflashing</h3>
        <p>When roofs get replaced, sometimes contractors reuse old flashing to save money. Old flashing on a new roof is a leak waiting to happen.</p>

        <h2>Signs Your Flashing Is Failing</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Water stains on ceiling near chimney</li>
            <li>Visible rust on flashing</li>
            <li>Cracked or missing caulk/sealant</li>
            <li>Flashing pulling away from chimney</li>
            <li>Gaps where flashing meets masonry</li>
            <li>Missing pieces (they can blow off)</li>
            <li>Moss or debris collecting at base of chimney</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Repair vs Replace</h2>

        <p><strong>Minor repairs</strong> – resealing, patching small gaps – might cost $150-400 and buy you a few more years.</p>

        <p><strong>Full flashing replacement</strong> typically runs $500-1500 for a standard chimney, depending on size and complexity.</p>

        <p>If your flashing is original to a roof that's 15+ years old, replacement usually makes more sense than repeated repairs. You're just delaying the inevitable.</p>

        <h2>The Cricket Question</h2>

        <p>Chimneys wider than 30 inches should have a cricket – a small peaked structure behind the chimney that diverts water. Many older homes don't have them.</p>

        <p>Without a cricket, water and debris pile up behind the chimney. This accelerates deterioration and makes leaks more likely.</p>

        <p>If you're having flashing work done on a wide chimney that lacks a cricket, it's worth adding one. Costs $300-600 extra but prevents a lot of future problems.</p>

        <h2>Why Caulk Alone Doesn't Work</h2>

        <p>Here's something to watch for: some contractors will just smear caulk all over your flashing and call it fixed. This is a band-aid at best.</p>

        <p>Caulk breaks down with UV exposure. It cracks with temperature changes. In Knoxville's climate, a caulk-only fix might last 2-5 years. Maybe less.</p>

        <p>Proper flashing repair involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Removing old sealants completely</li>
            <li>Replacing any damaged flashing pieces</li>
            <li>Ensuring proper overlap between components</li>
            <li>Setting counter flashing properly in mortar joints</li>
            <li>Using appropriate sealants in addition to (not instead of) mechanical protection</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who Should Do the Work?</h2>

        <p>Flashing repair is one of those gray areas. Some people say call a roofer. Some say call a mason. Here's how to think about it:</p>

        <p><strong>Call a roofer if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The flashing itself is the problem</li>
            <li>You need a cricket installed</li>
            <li>It's part of a roof replacement</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Call a mason if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The chimney masonry is cracked or damaged</li>
            <li>The mortar joints where counter flashing sits are failing</li>
            <li>The chimney needs tuckpointing or repair</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Often the answer is both. A mason fixes the chimney, then a roofer installs proper flashing. Coordinate this or find a company that does both.</p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Inspect annually – look for obvious gaps, rust, separated pieces</li>
            <li>Clear debris from behind the chimney regularly</li>
            <li>Address chimney masonry issues promptly</li>
            <li>When replacing your roof, insist on new flashing (don't let them reuse old)</li>
        </ul>
