        <h1>How to Choose the Right Roofing Contractor in Knoxville</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated February 2025 • 9 min read</p>

        <p>Choosing a roofing contractor is one of the most important home improvement decisions you'll make. A great contractor delivers quality work that protects your home for decades. A bad one can leave you with leaks, damage, and regret.</p>

        <p>Here's how homeowners in <a href="/west-knoxville/">West Knoxville</a>, <a href="/farragut/">Farragut</a>, <a href="/powell/">Powell</a>, and throughout Knox County can find the right roofer for their project.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Verify Basic Credentials</h2>

        <p>Before anything else, confirm these essentials:</p>

        <h3>Tennessee Contractor's License</h3>
        <p>Tennessee requires contractors to be licensed for projects over $25,000. Verify at verify.tn.gov. The license should be active and in good standing.</p>

        <h3>Insurance Coverage</h3>
        <p>Require proof of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General liability:</strong> At least $1 million (protects you if they damage your property)</li>
            <li><strong>Workers' compensation:</strong> Covers injuries to workers on your property</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Don't just accept a certificate – call the insurance company to verify coverage is current. Policies can be cancelled after a certificate is issued.
        </div>

        <h3>Physical Business Location</h3>
        <p>A real business address (not a PO box) indicates stability. You should be able to find them if issues arise later.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Research Their Reputation</h2>

        <h3>Online Reviews</h3>
        <p>Check multiple sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Business reviews</li>
            <li>Facebook recommendations</li>
            <li>Better Business Bureau (BBB)</li>
            <li>Angi (formerly Angie's List)</li>
            <li>HomeAdvisor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Look for patterns in reviews. A few complaints among many positives is normal; consistent complaints about the same issues are red flags.</p>

        <h3>Years in Business</h3>
        <p>Longevity matters. Companies that have served Knoxville for 10+ years have built a reputation worth protecting. New companies aren't necessarily bad, but they're unproven.</p>

        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>Ask for 5-10 recent references and actually call a few. Questions to ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Was the work completed on time and on budget?</li>
            <li>How was communication throughout the project?</li>
            <li>Did they clean up properly when done?</li>
            <li>Have you had any issues since completion?</li>
            <li>Would you hire them again?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 3: Get Multiple Quotes</h2>

        <p>Always get at least three written quotes. This helps you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand fair market pricing</li>
            <li>Compare what's included</li>
            <li>Identify outliers (too high or suspiciously low)</li>
            <li>Evaluate how contractors communicate</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What a Quote Should Include</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed scope of work</li>
            <li>Materials to be used (brand, type, color)</li>
            <li>Removal and disposal of old materials</li>
            <li>Underlayment and flashing specifications</li>
            <li>Ventilation work</li>
            <li>Timeline for completion</li>
            <li>Payment schedule</li>
            <li>Warranty information</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="checklist-box">
            <strong>Comparing quotes:</strong> Don't just compare total price. Compare what you're getting. A lower bid might mean cheaper materials, skipped steps, or corners cut.
        </div>

        <h2>Step 4: Meet and Evaluate</h2>

        <p>Have contractors visit your property. This gives you valuable information:</p>

        <h3>How Thoroughly Do They Inspect?</h3>
        <p>A good contractor doesn't quote from the ground or a quick glance. They should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Examine the roof up close (or use drone/binoculars for steep roofs)</li>
            <li>Check the attic if accessible</li>
            <li>Look at ventilation</li>
            <li>Inspect flashing, valleys, and penetrations</li>
            <li>Note the number of layers currently installed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Well Do They Communicate?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do they explain things clearly?</li>
            <li>Do they answer questions patiently?</li>
            <li>Do they pressure you or give you space to decide?</li>
            <li>Are they responsive to calls and messages?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Do They Seem Professional?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Are they on time for appointments?</li>
            <li>Do they have professional vehicles and equipment?</li>
            <li>Are their workers uniformed or identifiable?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 5: Understand the Contract</h2>

        <p>Never start work without a written contract. It should include:</p>

        <h3>Essential Contract Elements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Full company name, address, license number</li>
            <li>Complete description of work to be performed</li>
            <li>All materials to be used (specific brands and products)</li>
            <li>Total price and payment schedule</li>
            <li>Project start date and estimated completion</li>
            <li>Who obtains permits</li>
            <li>Warranty details (workmanship and materials)</li>
            <li>Change order process</li>
            <li>Cleanup and debris removal</li>
            <li>Insurance requirements</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Payment Terms to Expect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Deposit: 10-30% is typical (never more than 1/3)</li>
            <li>Progress payment: After materials are delivered and/or work begins</li>
            <li>Final payment: Upon satisfactory completion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Red Flags to Avoid</h2>

        <p>Walk away if a contractor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can't provide license or insurance documentation</li>
            <li>Pressures you to sign immediately</li>
            <li>Offers a price "only good today"</li>
            <li>Asks for large upfront payment (50%+)</li>
            <li>Wants to skip permits</li>
            <li>Has no physical business address</li>
            <li>Offers to waive your insurance deductible</li>
            <li>Shows up uninvited after a storm</li>
            <li>Can't provide references</li>
            <li>Has unusually low prices compared to competitors</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>CertainTeed SELECT ShingleMaster:</strong> Rigorous certification program</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Good reputation and business practices</li>
