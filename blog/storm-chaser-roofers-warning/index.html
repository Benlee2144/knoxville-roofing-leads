        <h1>Storm Chaser Roofers: Don't Become Their Next Victim</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated February 2025 • 7 min read</p>

        <p>After every major storm in Knoxville and East Tennessee, they arrive. Trucks with out-of-state plates. Door knockers with rehearsed pitches. "Roofing contractors" who didn't exist in town last week and won't be here next month.</p>

        <p>They're called storm chasers, and they've cost Tennessee homeowners millions of dollars in shoddy work, insurance fraud, and outright theft.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>This is different from our general scam warning.</strong> While we cover <a href="/blog/roofing-scams-to-avoid/">common roofing scams</a> elsewhere, storm chasers are a specific breed that descends on communities after severe weather. They exploit the urgency of the situation and homeowners' desperation to get repairs done.
        </div>

        <h2>What Is a Storm Chaser Roofer?</h2>

        <p>Storm chasers are roofing crews that travel from disaster to disaster, following severe weather events. They typically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show up within days of a major storm</li>
            <li>Have no local presence or reputation</li>
            <li>Use high-pressure sales tactics</li>
            <li>Promise to handle your insurance claim</li>
            <li>Do substandard work (or no work at all)</li>
            <li>Leave town before problems surface</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They prey on homeowners in <a href="/west-knoxville/">West Knoxville</a>, <a href="/farragut/">Farragut</a>, <a href="/powell/">Powell</a>, and throughout Knox County every time we get significant hail or wind damage.</p>

        <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>

        <div class="red-flag">
            <h3>1. They Knock on Your Door</h3>
            <p>Legitimate contractors don't canvas neighborhoods looking for work. They have enough business from referrals and their reputation. If someone shows up uninvited after a storm, be very cautious.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="red-flag">
            <h3>2. Out-of-State Plates</h3>
            <p>Check their truck. Out-of-state license plates (especially from states known for roofing fraud like Florida or Texas) are a major warning sign.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="red-flag">
            <h3>3. They Offer to Handle Everything with Your Insurance</h3>
            <p>"Just sign this, and we'll deal with your insurance company." This is often a setup for insurance fraud, inflated claims, or work that doesn't match what was claimed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="red-flag">
            <h3>4. Pressure to Sign Today</h3>
            <p>"We have crews available right now, but only if you sign today." Legitimate contractors understand you need time to get multiple quotes and make decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="red-flag">
            <h3>5. Large Upfront Payment Required</h3>
            <p>"We need 50% down to order materials." Then they disappear, or they do partial work and demand more money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="red-flag">
            <h3>6. No Physical Business Address</h3>
            <p>They have a website (maybe), business cards, but no actual office you can visit. Google their address – is it real?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="red-flag">
            <h3>7. They Claim to Find Damage You Didn't Know About</h3>
            <p>"I was just driving by and noticed your roof has major damage." Be especially suspicious if they offer to climb up and inspect for free.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Storm Chaser Playbook</h2>

        <p>Here's how the typical scam works:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>First contact:</strong> They knock on your door or leave a flyer within days of a storm</li>
            <li><strong>Free inspection:</strong> They offer to check your roof at no cost</li>
            <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> They "find" extensive damage (sometimes creating it themselves)</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance promise:</strong> They offer to work directly with your insurance company</li>
            <li><strong>Contract signing:</strong> They push for immediate commitment with high-pressure tactics</li>
            <li><strong>Upfront payment:</strong> They collect a large deposit before starting work</li>
            <li><strong>Substandard work:</strong> They do quick, cheap repairs that won't last</li>
            <li><strong>Exit:</strong> They leave town before you realize the problems</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Damage They Leave Behind</h2>

        <p>Storm chaser victims often end up with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work that fails within months</li>
            <li>Voided manufacturer warranties</li>
            <li>Code violations that cause problems when selling</li>
            <li>Insurance claims that are denied or lead to dropped coverage</li>
            <li>No recourse because the company can't be found</li>
            <li>The need to pay again to have the work done properly</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="blog-cta">
            <h3>Find Trusted Local Roofers</h3>
            <p>Connect with established Knoxville contractors who'll be here long after the storm passes.</p>

        <h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>

        <h3>After a Storm</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Don't panic.</strong> You have time to make a good decision</li>
            <li><strong>Document damage yourself</strong> with photos and video before anyone touches your roof</li>
            <li><strong>Contact your insurance company</strong> directly to file a claim</li>
            <li><strong>Get multiple quotes</strong> from established local contractors</li>
            <li><strong>Verify credentials</strong> – license, insurance, local references</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>When Vetting Contractors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check their Tennessee contractor's license at verify.tn.gov</li>
            <li>Verify insurance by calling the insurance company directly</li>
            <li>Look for consistent local reviews over multiple years</li>
            <li>Ask for local references you can actually contact</li>
            <li>Verify their physical address exists</li>
            <li>Check Better Business Bureau for complaints</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Contract Must-Haves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Full company name and physical address</li>
            <li>Contractor's license number</li>
            <li>Detailed scope of work</li>
            <li>Materials to be used (brand, model)</li>
            <li>Payment schedule (no more than 30% upfront)</li>
            <li>Timeline for completion</li>
            <li>Warranty information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What If You've Already Hired One?</h2>

        <p>If you realize you've hired a storm chaser:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Stop payment</strong> if possible (credit card dispute, stop check)</li>
            <li><strong>Document everything</strong> – photos, contracts, communications</li>
            <li><strong>Don't let them on your property</strong> if work hasn't started</li>
            <li><strong>Contact a lawyer</strong> if they've taken money and not performed</li>
            <li><strong>File complaints</strong> with the Tennessee Board for Licensing Contractors, BBB, and state attorney general</li>
            <li><strong>Report to police</strong> if they've committed fraud or theft</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Legitimate Contractors Exist</h2>

        <p>Don't let fear of storm chasers keep you from getting necessary repairs. Reputable contractors in <a href="/maryville/">Maryville</a>, <a href="/oak-ridge/">Oak Ridge</a>, <a href="/sevierville/">Sevierville</a>, and throughout the Knoxville area do exist and do great work.</p>

        <p>The key differences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They don't knock on doors</li>
            <li>They have years of local history</li>
            <li>They don't pressure you to sign immediately</li>
            <li>They work with your insurance properly</li>
            <li>They have verifiable references and reviews</li>
            <li>They'll be here next year when you need warranty service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Report Storm Chasers</h2>

        <p>If you encounter storm chasers in your neighborhood, report them:</p>
        <ul>
