        <h1>Roof Repair vs Replacement: How to Actually Decide</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 7 min read</p>

        <p>You've got a roof problem. Maybe a leak. Maybe missing shingles. Maybe the inspector flagged something during a home sale. Now you're wondering: can I just fix this, or do I need a whole new roof?</p>

        <p>This isn't always an easy call. Let me walk you through how to think about it.</p>

        <h2>The Quick Answer</h2>

        <div class="decision-box">
            <p><strong>Probably repair if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Roof is under 15 years old</li>
                <li>Damage is localized to one area</li>
                <li>Less than 30% of the roof is affected</li>
                <li>No structural issues (sagging, rot)</li>
                <li>You can match the existing shingles</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Probably replace if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Roof is 20+ years old</li>
                <li>Damage is widespread</li>
                <li>You've already had multiple repairs</li>
                <li>Structural damage exists</li>
                <li>You're planning to sell soon</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>But life's rarely that simple. Let's dig deeper.</p>

        <h2>The Age Factor</h2>

        <p>Roof age is the biggest piece of the puzzle. Here's why: a repair on a young roof buys you decades. A repair on an old roof buys you... not much.</p>

        <p>Say your 10-year-old roof gets damaged in a storm. Repair makes sense. You've still got 15+ years of life in those shingles. That $800 repair is money well spent.</p>

        <p>Now say your 22-year-old roof has the same damage. Sure, you could patch it for $800. But the rest of the roof is nearing the end anyway. You're likely to have more issues within a few years. At some point, repairs become throwing money at a lost cause.</p>

        <h2>The 30% Rule</h2>

        <p>This is a general guideline roofing professionals use: if more than 30% of your roof needs work, replacement usually makes more sense than repair.</p>

        <p>Why? Because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Labor costs add up. At some point, patching multiple areas costs almost as much as replacing.</li>
            <li>The remaining 70% is the same age and will have the same problems soon.</li>
            <li>Patched roofs look patched. Different shingle batches don't match perfectly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Structural vs Surface Damage</h2>

        <p>This distinction matters a lot:</p>

        <p><strong>Surface damage</strong> means the shingles themselves are affected – missing tabs, cracks, granule loss. This is often repairable.</p>

        <p><strong>Structural damage</strong> means the underlying decking or rafters are compromised – rot, water damage, sagging. This is serious. You can't just slap new shingles on a rotten deck.</p>

        <p>If you have structural damage, you need more than a repair. Whether that means full replacement or a partial rebuild depends on how extensive it is.</p>

        <h2>The Math Problem</h2>

        <p>Let's talk numbers with a realistic example:</p>

        <p>Say you have a 17-year-old roof that's been through some hail. Estimate to repair: $2,500. Estimate for full replacement: $12,000.</p>

        <p>At first glance, $2,500 sounds way better. But think about it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>That roof might have 5-8 years left max.</li>
            <li>You'll probably need more repairs in that time.</li>
            <li>When you do replace, you'll pay again for tear-off, disposal, and labor.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now say the roof was 8 years old. Same numbers. Different calculus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You've got 15+ years of life remaining.</li>
            <li>One repair could easily carry you to the roof's natural end.</li>
            <li>That $2,500 buys you real value.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Selling Your Home?</h2>

        <p>If you're planning to sell within the next few years, this changes everything.</p>

        <p><strong>Buyer psychology:</strong> Roof age and condition are one of the first things buyers and inspectors check. A new roof is a selling point. A patched old roof raises red flags.</p>

        <p><strong>Negotiation leverage:</strong> Buyers will use an old roof to negotiate price down. You might give up more in negotiations than the replacement would have cost.</p>

        <p><strong>Deal killers:</strong> Some buyers (especially first-timers) will walk away from roof issues entirely. Their lender might require it to be fixed anyway.</p>

        <p>If you're selling soon and your roof is borderline, replacement often makes the sale smoother and faster.</p>

        <h2>The Matching Problem</h2>

        <p>Here's something people don't think about: can you actually match your existing shingles?</p>

        <p>Shingle colors get discontinued. Even the "same" color from a different batch won't match perfectly. Your existing shingles have weathered and faded.</p>

        <p>A small repair blends in fine. A large repair can look like a patchwork quilt. If half your roof is visibly mismatched, you might wish you'd just replaced the whole thing.</p>

        <h2>When Contractors Disagree</h2>

        <p>You'll often get different recommendations from different contractors. Some push replacement because it's a bigger job. Some push repair because it's quick money. How do you know who's right?</p>

        <p>Get multiple opinions. If three out of four contractors say replace, believe them. If opinions are split, ask each one to explain their reasoning. The contractor who can clearly articulate why they're recommending what they're recommending is probably the most trustworthy.</p>

        <h2>The Questions to Ask Yourself</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>How old is the roof?</strong> Under 15 = lean toward repair. Over 20 = lean toward replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>How extensive is the damage?</strong> One area = repair. Multiple areas = replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>Have I already repaired this roof?</strong> If yes, you're probably past the repair phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Is there structural damage?</strong> If yes, repair isn't enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Am I selling soon?</strong> If yes, consider replacement for better sale value.</li>
            <li><strong>What's my budget reality?</strong> Sometimes repair is what you can do now, even if replacement would be ideal.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>One More Thing</h2>

        <p>There's no shame in repairing when that's what makes sense for you right now. Not everyone has $12,000 sitting around. A well-done repair can buy you time to save up for eventual replacement.</p>

        <p>Just go in with eyes open. Know whether you're making a long-term fix or buying time. And choose a contractor who gives you the honest truth, even when it's complicated.</p>
