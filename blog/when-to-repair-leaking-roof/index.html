            <h3>If water is actively pouring in:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put buckets under the drip</li>
                <li>Move furniture and electronics</li>
                <li>If the ceiling is bulging, poke a small hole to drain it (prevents collapse)</li>
                <li>Call a roofer for emergency service</li>

        </div>

        <p>Alright, hopefully you're not in full crisis mode. Let's talk about what causes leaks, how to find them, and what to do next.</p>

        <h2>Why Roofs Leak</h2>

        <p>Water is sneaky. It doesn't always drip straight down. It follows paths – along rafters, down pipes, through gaps you'd never notice. Here are the most common causes:</p>

        <h3>Damaged or Missing Shingles</h3>
        <p>Wind, age, or impact damage leaves gaps. Water gets under the remaining shingles and into the deck.</p>

        <h3>Failed Flashing</h3>
        <p>Flashing is the metal pieces around chimneys, vents, skylights, and roof joints. It's supposed to direct water away from vulnerable spots. When it fails – rusts through, lifts, or loses its seal – water gets in. This is probably the #1 leak cause.</p>

        <h3>Clogged Gutters</h3>
        <p>Backed up gutters push water under the roof edge. This causes soffit damage and can work its way inside.</p>

        <h3>Ice Dams</h3>
        <p>In winter, ice buildup at the roof edge traps water behind it. That water has nowhere to go but under your shingles.</p>

        <h3>Condensation</h3>
        <p>Not technically a "leak" but produces the same result. Poor attic ventilation causes moisture to condense on the underside of the deck. It drips down like a leak. Common culprit when the "leak" only happens sometimes.</p>

        <h3>Plumbing/HVAC Issues</h3>
        <p>Sometimes what looks like a roof leak is actually a plumbing leak from above, or condensation from AC ductwork in the attic. Worth checking before assuming roof.</p>

        <h2>Finding the Source</h2>

        <p>Here's the frustrating part: where water shows up inside isn't necessarily where the leak is. Water can travel 10 feet or more before it drops through your ceiling.</p>

        <h3>Start in the Attic</h3>
        <p>If you have attic access, go up there during or right after a rain (carefully – it might be slippery). Look for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Active dripping</li>
            <li>Water trails on rafters or decking</li>
            <li>Dark stains or discoloration</li>
            <li>Wet insulation</li>
            <li>Daylight showing through (shouldn't happen)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Trace any water trails upward to find the entry point.</p>

        <h3>Check the Usual Suspects</h3>
        <p>Most leaks happen at:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Around chimneys</li>
            <li>Around vent pipes</li>
            <li>At roof valleys</li>
            <li>Around skylights</li>
            <li>Where additions meet the main roof</li>
            <li>At flashing points</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Garden Hose Test</h3>
        <p>If you can't find the source, have someone inside while you spray sections of the roof with a hose. Start low, work up. When they yell "I see water!" you've found the area. (This is a two-person job. Don't try it alone.)</p>

        <h2>Temporary Fixes</h2>

        <p>You've found the general area. A roofer can't come until tomorrow. Here's how to minimize damage:</p>

        <h3>Tarping</h3>
        <p>A tarp is your best friend for emergency leaks. Get one big enough to extend past the damaged area on all sides. Secure it with weights or sandbags – don't nail through it.</p>

        <p>Important: tarps are temporary. They blow off, they shift, they eventually fail. Don't leave a tarp up for months thinking the problem is solved.</p>

        <h3>Roofing Cement</h3>
        <p>For small issues like lifted flashing or a gap around a pipe, roofing cement (also called roof tar or sealant) can provide a temporary seal. It's available at any hardware store. Clean the area, apply liberally, smooth it down.</p>

        <p>Again: temporary. This buys time, not years.</p>

        <h3>Bucket Brigade</h3>
        <p>If you can't stop the leak, contain it. Buckets, plastic bins, towels under them to catch splashes. Empty regularly. Check throughout the night if rain continues.</p>

        <h2>When to DIY vs Call a Pro</h2>

        <h3>You Can Probably Handle:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Replacing a single cracked or missing shingle (if you're comfortable on roofs)</li>
            <li>Applying sealant to a minor flashing gap</li>
            <li>Clearing debris from a valley</li>
            <li>Unclogging gutters</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Call a Professional For:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Anything requiring you to work on a steep slope</li>
            <li>Multiple damaged shingles</li>
            <li>Chimney flashing issues</li>
            <li>Skylight leaks</li>
            <li>Leaks you can't locate</li>
            <li>Any structural damage</li>
            <li>Warranty concerns (DIY repair might void coverage)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Hidden Damage Problem</h2>

        <p>Here's what people don't realize: by the time you see water dripping inside, damage has been happening for a while. The leak path gets soaked first. Insulation absorbs water. Wood starts to rot.</p>

        <p>Getting the leak fixed quickly isn't just about stopping the drip – it's about preventing or limiting the hidden damage. The longer water gets in, the worse it gets.</p>

        <p>After the leak is fixed, have someone look in the attic to assess what got wet. Saturated insulation should be replaced. Any wood showing signs of rot needs attention.</p>

        <h2>Insurance Considerations</h2>

        <p>Most homeowner's policies cover sudden damage (like a storm ripping off shingles). They usually don't cover gradual damage (like a slow leak you ignored for a year).</p>

        <p>Document everything. Take photos of the damage, inside and out. Note when you first discovered it. Keep receipts for any emergency repairs. This makes the claims process much smoother.</p>

        <h2>Preventing Future Leaks</h2>

        <p>Once you've dealt with this leak, think about prevention:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Annual roof inspections catch problems early</li>
            <li>Keep gutters clean</li>
            <li>Trim trees that hang over the roof</li>
            <li>Check attic after major storms</li>
            <li>Address small issues before they become big ones</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A leak is stressful. But it's usually fixable. Take a breath, minimize the immediate damage, and get a professional out to handle it properly.</p>
