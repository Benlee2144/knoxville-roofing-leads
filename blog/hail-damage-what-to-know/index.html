        <h1>Hail Damage on Roofs: What Knoxville Homeowners Need to Know</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 6 min read</p>

        <p>East Tennessee gets its share of hailstorms. Some are barely noticeable. Others sound like someone's dumping gravel on your house. After the noise stops, you're left wondering: did my roof just get destroyed?</p>

        <p>Here's the thing about hail damage – it's not always what people think. Let me explain what's actually happening up there.</p>

        <h2>What Hail Actually Does to Shingles</h2>

        <p>When hail hits an asphalt shingle, it can cause a few different types of damage:</p>

        <h3>Granule Loss</h3>
        <p>This is the most common. The impact knocks loose the protective granules on the shingle surface. You might notice dark spots where the underlying asphalt is exposed. Those granules end up in your gutters.</p>

        <p>Why it matters: Granules protect the shingle from UV damage. Without them, the shingle deteriorates faster. Not an emergency, but it shortens roof life.</p>

        <h3>Bruising</h3>
        <p>The impact compresses the shingle, weakening the fiberglass mat underneath. You can sometimes feel this as a soft spot when you press on the shingle. From the ground, it's nearly invisible.</p>

        <p>Why it matters: Weakened shingles are more likely to crack or fail over time. Again, not immediate disaster, but long-term damage.</p>

        <h3>Cracking or Punctures</h3>
        <p>Larger hail (golf ball and up) can actually crack shingles or punch holes through them. This is the serious stuff that needs immediate attention.</p>

        <p>Why it matters: Holes in your roof = water gets in. This needs to be fixed fast.</p>

        <h2>The Size Question</h2>

        <p>How big does hail need to be to cause damage? Depends on your shingles, but generally:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pea size (1/4"):</strong> Usually no damage to roofs, maybe dings gutters</li>
            <li><strong>Marble size (1/2"):</strong> Can cause cosmetic damage to shingles</li>
            <li><strong>Quarter size (1"):</strong> Likely causing granule loss, possible bruising</li>
            <li><strong>Golf ball (1.75"):</strong> Almost certainly damaging shingles</li>
            <li><strong>Baseball (2.75"+):</strong> We're talking holes and broken shingles</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Wind matters too. Hail driven by 50 mph wind hits way harder than hail falling straight down.</p>

        <h2>What to Check After a Storm</h2>

        <p>Don't climb on your roof – that's dangerous and unnecessary. Here's what you can check from the ground:</p>

        <h3>Gutters and Downspouts</h3>
        <p>Look for dents. Aluminum gutters show hail damage clearly. If they're beat up, your roof probably took some hits too.</p>

        <h3>Outdoor AC Unit</h3>
        <p>The fins on your AC compressor dent easily. If they look hammered, the hail was significant.</p>

        <h3>Soft Metals Around Your Home</h3>
        <p>Mailboxes, car hoods, window frames. Dents here indicate damaging hail.</p>

        <h3>Shingles (From the Ground)</h3>
        <p>With binoculars, look for obvious missing pieces, dark spots, or areas that look different from the rest. But honestly, real hail damage assessment requires being on the roof.</p>

        <h2>The Storm Chaser Problem</h2>

        <p>Here's where I have to give you a warning. After any significant hailstorm in Knoxville, you'll see trucks with out-of-state plates and guys going door to door offering free inspections.</p>

        <p>Some of these companies are legitimate. Many are not.</p>

        <p>The shady ones use high-pressure tactics, exaggerate damage, and try to get you to sign contracts on the spot. They might do the work and disappear before you realize there are problems. When you need warranty service, good luck finding them.</p>

        <p>Red flags:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They knocked on your door unsolicited</li>
            <li>They pressure you to decide immediately</li>
            <li>They offer to "cover your deductible" (that's fraud)</li>
            <li>They want you to sign over insurance claim rights</li>
            <li>You can't find them on Google with local reviews</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Stick with established local contractors who've been in the Knoxville area for years.</p>

        <h2>When to File an Insurance Claim</h2>

        <p>Not every hail event justifies a claim. Here's how to think about it:</p>

        <p><strong>File a claim if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A reputable contractor confirms significant damage</li>
            <li>Damage exceeds your deductible substantially</li>
            <li>You have functional damage (not just cosmetic)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Think twice if:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Damage is minimal or cosmetic</li>
            <li>Repairs would cost less than or near your deductible</li>
            <li>You've had multiple claims recently (rates could increase)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some people file claims for every little thing. That can backfire – too many claims can get your policy dropped or premiums jacked up.</p>

        <h2>The Inspection Process</h2>

        <p>A legitimate hail damage inspection works like this:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Contractor gets on the roof (safely, with proper equipment)</li>
            <li>They look for impact marks in a systematic pattern</li>
            <li>They document damage with photos</li>
            <li>They check soft metals (vents, flashing) for comparison</li>
            <li>They give you an honest assessment – maybe it's bad, maybe it's not</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A good contractor will tell you when damage doesn't warrant a claim. They know their reputation matters more than one job.</p>

        <h2>Impact Resistant Shingles</h2>

        <p>If you're replacing your roof anyway, consider impact-resistant shingles (Class 3 or 4). They're made with a tougher polymer-modified asphalt that handles hail better.</p>

        <p>They cost 10-20% more than standard shingles. But many insurance companies offer premium discounts for Class 4 rated roofs. Do the math – the discount might offset the extra cost over time.</p>

        <div class="blog-cta">
            <h3>Concerned About Storm Damage?</h3>
            <p>Get an honest inspection from a local Knoxville contractor. No pressure, no obligation.</p>
            <a href="/#quote-form">Schedule Free Inspection</a>
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>Hail damage is real, but it's also oversold by companies looking to make money off your insurance. Don't panic after every storm. Don't sign anything the day someone knocks on your door.</p>

        <p>If you're genuinely concerned, call a local roofer you trust. Get an honest assessment. Then decide what makes sense based on facts, not fear.</p>
