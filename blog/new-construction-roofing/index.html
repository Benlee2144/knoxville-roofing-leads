        <h1>New Construction Roofing: What Homebuyers Should Know</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 6 min read</p>

        <p>When you're building a new home, there are a million decisions. Cabinet finishes. Flooring. Paint colors. The roof usually gets about 30 seconds of thought: "Yeah, I guess that gray looks fine."</p>

        <p>But the roof is one of the biggest cost items in your home – and one of the hardest to change later. Here's what you should actually be thinking about.</p>

        <h2>What Builders Typically Include</h2>

        <p>Most builders have a "standard" roofing package. In Knoxville, that usually means:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basic 3-tab or entry-level architectural shingles</li>
            <li>25-30 year warranty shingles</li>
            <li>Standard synthetic underlayment</li>
            <li>Minimum code-required ventilation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is perfectly fine. It meets code. It'll work. But it's also the cheapest option that's acceptable. You can often do better.</p>

        <h2>Upgrades Worth Considering</h2>

        <h3>Better Shingles</h3>

        <p><strong>Architectural shingles</strong> (if not already standard): Thicker, more dimensional, longer-lasting than 3-tab. Usually a minor upgrade cost but adds 5-10 years of life.</p>

        <p><strong>Impact-resistant shingles:</strong> Class 3 or 4 rated shingles can save you on insurance premiums. Some insurers give 10-25% discounts. Do the math over 20 years – the upgrade might pay for itself.</p>

        <p><strong>Premium brands:</strong> The difference between builder-grade and premium shingles (like GAF Timberline HDZ vs. entry-level architectural) isn't huge in cost but is noticeable in appearance and durability.</p>

        <h3>Better Underlayment</h3>

        <p>Underlayment is the layer under your shingles. Upgrades include:</p>

        <p><strong>Synthetic underlayment:</strong> More durable than traditional felt, lies flatter. Most builders use this now, but verify.</p>

        <p><strong>Ice and water shield:</strong> Waterproof membrane at eaves, valleys, and around penetrations. Code requires some, but more coverage is better, especially in valleys.</p>

        <h3>Enhanced Ventilation</h3>

        <p>Minimum code ventilation is just that – minimum. Better ventilation means:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Longer shingle life</li>
            <li>Lower attic temperatures in summer</li>
            <li>Reduced ice dam risk</li>
            <li>Better moisture control</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A continuous ridge vent (vs. box vents) with adequate soffit intake is a worthwhile upgrade.</p>

        <h2>Questions to Ask Your Builder</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>What brand and model of shingles are included?</li>
            <li>What's the warranty on the standard package?</li>
            <li>What upgrade options are available, and what do they cost?</li>
            <li>Who's the roofing subcontractor?</li>
            <li>Will there be a final roof inspection?</li>
            <li>How is the warranty handled – through you or the sub?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Subcontractor Question</h2>

        <p>Builders usually subcontract roofing. The quality of that sub matters a lot. A good builder uses reliable subs they've worked with for years. Budget builders use whoever's cheapest.</p>

        <p>You can ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who typically does your roofing?</li>
            <li>How long have you worked with them?</li>
            <li>Can I see examples of their work?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some contracts allow you to hire your own roofer. This is unusual but not unheard of, especially with custom builds. Worth asking if you have a trusted roofer.</p>

        <h2>Inspection Tips</h2>

        <p>During construction, have your home inspector check the roof at these stages:</p>

        <h3>Pre-Shingle</h3>
        <p>Before shingles go on, check:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decking is properly fastened</li>
            <li>Underlayment is installed correctly</li>
            <li>Ice and water shield is in the right places</li>
            <li>Drip edge is installed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>After Completion</h3>
        <p>Check:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shingles laid properly, aligned correctly</li>
            <li>Flashing around all penetrations</li>
            <li>Ridge vent installed correctly</li>
            <li>No exposed nails</li>
            <li>Valleys done properly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Standard home inspections check the roof, but having someone look specifically at roof work during construction catches problems that would be hidden later.</p>

        <h2>What About Metal Roofing?</h2>

        <p>Some builders offer metal roofing upgrades. In new construction, this can be more affordable than retrofitting later. If you're considering metal, this is the time.</p>

        <p>Consider metal if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You plan to stay long-term (metal pays back over time)</li>
            <li>The home's style suits it</li>
            <li>You want minimal maintenance</li>
            <li>Energy efficiency is a priority</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The premium is usually 50-100% more than shingles. Get the exact numbers from your builder.</p>

        <h2>Don't Forget the Warranty</h2>

        <p>Get clear documentation on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturer warranty on shingles</li>
            <li>Workmanship warranty from the roofing sub</li>
            <li>What's covered under builder's warranty</li>
            <li>How to file warranty claims</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Make sure the manufacturer warranty gets properly registered. This often requires specific paperwork that gets forgotten in the construction chaos.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>Your roof isn't as exciting as kitchen counters. But it's going to be on your house for 20-30 years, and it protects everything underneath it. Spend an hour thinking about it during construction, and you won't spend years regretting shortcuts.</p>
