        <h1>12 Questions to Ask Before Hiring a Roofing Contractor</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 8 min read</p>

        <p>Getting a new roof isn't like buying something on Amazon. You can't just return it if it sucks. Once that roof is on, you're living with it for decades – or living with the problems if you hired the wrong company.</p>

        <p>I've talked to homeowners who got burned by bad contractors. Every single one said some version of "I wish I'd asked more questions." So here are the questions you should ask before signing anything.</p>

        <h2>1. "Are you licensed and insured?"</h2>

        <p>This isn't optional. In Tennessee, roofing contractors need a license for jobs over $25,000. They also need liability insurance and workers' compensation.</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> They hesitate, get vague, or say "we're working on it."</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> They immediately offer to show you their credentials or send copies.</div>

        <p>Verify independently. You can check Tennessee contractor licenses at <a href="https://verify.tn.gov">verify.tn.gov</a>. Call their insurance company to confirm coverage is current.</p>

        <h2>2. "How long have you been in business?"</h2>

        <p>Roofing companies come and go. A lot of them pop up after storms, do questionable work, and disappear when problems arise. You want someone who'll still be around when you need warranty service.</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> Less than 3 years in business, or they can't give you a straight answer.</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> 5+ years with a verifiable track record in the Knoxville area.</div>

        <h2>3. "Can I see some references from recent jobs?"</h2>

        <p>Any contractor can show you their best work. Ask for 5-10 references from the past year. Then actually call some of them. Ask about communication, cleanup, whether the final price matched the quote, and if there were any issues.</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> They only have 2-3 references or they're all from years ago.</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> They happily provide a list and encourage you to call anyone on it.</div>

        <h2>4. "Who will actually be doing the work?"</h2>

        <p>Some companies use their own trained crews. Others subcontract to whoever's available. Subcontractors aren't automatically bad, but you want to know what you're getting.</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> They can't tell you, or they say "whoever's available that day."</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> They have regular crews they've worked with for years.</div>

        <h2>5. "Will you pull the permit?"</h2>

        <p>Knox County requires permits for roof replacements. The contractor should handle this, not you. Permits mean inspections, and inspections mean accountability.</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> "We don't need a permit" or "You can save money skipping the permit."</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> Permit fees are included in their quote as a line item.</div>

        <h2>6. "What's included in the price?"</h2>

        <p>Get specifics. A quote should break down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tear-off (are they removing old shingles or going over?)</li>
            <li>Materials (brand, type, color)</li>
            <li>Underlayment</li>
            <li>Flashing (new or reusing old?)</li>
            <li>Ventilation</li>
            <li>Cleanup and haul-away</li>
            <li>Dump fees</li>
            <li>Permit</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> A single lump-sum number with no breakdown.</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> Itemized quote that explains exactly what you're paying for.</div>

        <h2>7. "What happens if you find damage under the shingles?"</h2>

        <p>Nobody knows for sure what's under your roof until they tear it off. Rotted decking, damaged rafters – it happens. Know upfront how this is handled.</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> "That never happens" or no clear answer.</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> They explain their per-sheet price for decking replacement and will call you before doing any extra work.</div>

        <h2>8. "What warranty do I get?"</h2>

        <p>There are two types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manufacturer warranty:</strong> Covers defects in the shingles themselves. Usually 25-50 years, but read the fine print.</li>
            <li><strong>Workmanship warranty:</strong> Covers the installation. This is from the contractor. Industry standard is 5-10 years.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> "Lifetime warranty!" with no written details, or workmanship warranty under 2 years.</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> Clear written warranty documents for both manufacturer and workmanship.</div>

        <h2>9. "What's your payment schedule?"</h2>

        <p>Never pay in full upfront. A typical structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deposit (10-30%) to secure scheduling and order materials</li>
            <li>Progress payment when materials arrive or work starts</li>
            <li>Final payment after completion and inspection</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> They want 50%+ upfront or full payment before starting.</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> Most payment is due after the work is complete.</div>

        <h2>10. "How do you handle cleanup?"</h2>

        <p>Roof jobs create a mess. Shingle pieces, nails, packaging everywhere. A good contractor leaves your property cleaner than they found it.</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> Vague answer or "we clean up most of it."</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> They describe their process – tarps around the house, magnetic roller for nails, daily cleanup.</div>

        <h2>11. "Do you have any manufacturer certifications?"</h2>

        <p>Major shingle manufacturers (GAF, Owens Corning, CertainTeed) certify contractors who meet their installation standards. These certifications often come with better warranty options.</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> "Certifications don't matter" or they claim ones they can't prove.</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> They're certified by one or more major manufacturers and can show documentation.</div>

        <h2>12. "Can you walk me through your process?"</h2>

        <p>A good contractor should be able to explain step-by-step what happens from contract to completion. How do they communicate? Who's your point of contact? What's the schedule? What if it rains?</p>

        <div class="red-flag"><strong>Red flag:</strong> They can't explain their own process clearly.</div>
        <div class="green-flag"><strong>Good sign:</strong> They have a clear, organized system they've refined over time.</div>

        <h2>Bonus: Trust Your Gut</h2>

        <p>If something feels off, it probably is. The contractor who pressures you to sign today, won't put anything in writing, or talks trash about every competitor? Walk away.</p>

        <p>A good roofer wants you to feel confident in your decision. They answer questions patiently because they know informed customers make the best clients.</p>
