        <h1>7 Roofing Scams to Watch Out For</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 7 min read</p>

        <p>Every year, Tennessee homeowners lose money to roofing scams. Some lose a few hundred bucks. Some lose tens of thousands. The really unlucky ones end up with a destroyed roof and a contractor who's vanished.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to scare you. Most roofers are honest. But scammers exist, and they're good at what they do. Here's what to watch for.</p>

        <h2>1. The Door Knocker After a Storm</h2>

        <div class="scam-box">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> A stranger shows up the day after a storm. "I was in the neighborhood and noticed your roof has damage. I can fix it cheap if we do it today."
        </div>

        <p>Not everyone who knocks is a scammer. But this is the number one way bad contractors find victims. They travel from storm to storm, do quick cash jobs, and disappear.</p>

        <p><strong>Protect yourself:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never hire someone who shows up unsolicited</li>
            <li>Don't sign anything that day, no matter what they say</li>
            <li>Ask for their license number and verify it</li>
            <li>Google their company – if they have no local presence, walk away</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. The "Free Deductible" Deal</h2>

        <div class="scam-box">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> "We'll work with your insurance and cover your deductible so you pay nothing out of pocket!"
        </div>

        <p>This is insurance fraud. Full stop. They inflate the claim to cover the deductible, or they do substandard work to keep costs down. Either way, you're participating in a crime, and you could lose your homeowner's insurance.</p>

        <p><strong>Protect yourself:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If anyone offers to waive your deductible, end the conversation</li>
            <li>Legitimate contractors never do this</li>
            <li>Report these offers to your insurance company</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. The Giant Upfront Payment</h2>

        <div class="scam-box">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> "We need 50% upfront to order materials." They take the money and either disappear or do partial work before abandoning the job.
        </div>

        <p>Some deposit is normal – maybe 10-20% to secure scheduling and materials. But half or more upfront? That's a red flag.</p>

        <p><strong>Protect yourself:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never pay more than 30% upfront</li>
            <li>Structure payments around milestones (materials delivered, work completed)</li>
            <li>Final payment should be after the job is done and you're satisfied</li>
            <li>Pay by credit card or check – never cash</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. The Pressure Close</h2>

        <div class="scam-box">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> "This price is only good today." "I have a crew available tomorrow but I need your signature now." "Your roof is in critical condition – we need to act immediately."
        </div>

        <p>Creating urgency is a classic manipulation tactic. Legitimate contractors know you need time to compare quotes and make decisions. They don't pressure you because they don't need to – their work speaks for itself.</p>

        <p><strong>Protect yourself:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any contractor who won't give you time to decide isn't worth hiring</li>
            <li>Take at least a few days to compare options</li>
            <li>If they won't honor the price tomorrow, let them walk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. The Permit Skipper</h2>

        <div class="scam-box">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> "We don't need a permit for this" or "You'll save money if we skip the permit."
        </div>

        <p>Permits exist to protect you. They ensure work meets code and gets inspected. Skipping permits might save a few hundred dollars but creates huge problems:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Work might not meet code (safety issues)</li>
            <li>No inspection means no accountability</li>
            <li>Problems selling your house later</li>
            <li>Insurance might not cover damage from unpermitted work</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Protect yourself:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always insist on permits</li>
            <li>Verify the permit was actually pulled (check with Knox County)</li>
            <li>Get a copy of the passed inspection</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. The Lowball Bait-and-Switch</h2>

        <div class="scam-box">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> They give you a super low quote that beats everyone else. Once work starts, suddenly there are "unforeseen issues" that require expensive add-ons. Final price ends up way higher.
        </div>

        <p>Sometimes legitimate issues do come up during a roof job. But if the price keeps climbing and climbing, you might be getting scammed.</p>

        <p><strong>Protect yourself:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be suspicious of quotes way lower than competitors</li>
            <li>Get detailed written quotes that list everything included</li>
            <li>Ask how they handle unexpected deck damage (get a per-sheet price in writing)</li>
            <li>The contract should require your approval before any extra work</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. The Phantom Contractor</h2>

        <div class="scam-box">
            <strong>How it works:</strong> Everything seems legit. They have a website, business cards, maybe even some reviews. But try to find their physical address – it doesn't exist. They're just a guy with a truck and some cards.
        </div>

        <p>When something goes wrong, you need to be able to find your contractor. "We'll make it right" means nothing if they have no actual place of business.</p>

        <p><strong>Protect yourself:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify they have a real physical address (not a PO box)</li>
            <li>Check how long they've been at that location</li>
            <li>Look for consistent local reviews over multiple years</li>
            <li>Verify their license with the state</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Check a Contractor</h2>

        <p>Before signing anything, do this:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Check their Tennessee license</strong> at verify.tn.gov</li>
            <li><strong>Verify insurance</strong> – call the insurance company directly</li>
            <li><strong>Search their business name</strong> with "complaints" or "reviews"</li>
            <li><strong>Check the BBB</strong> for complaint history</li>
            <li><strong>Google their address</strong> – is it a real place?</li>
            <li><strong>Ask for references</strong> and actually call them</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What to Do If You've Been Scammed</h2>

        <p>If you think you've been taken:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Document everything – photos, contracts, communications, payments</li>
            <li>File a complaint with the Tennessee Board for Licensing Contractors</li>
            <li>Report to the BBB</li>
            <li>File a police report if they've taken money and disappeared</li>
            <li>Contact your credit card company if you paid by card (you may be able to dispute)</li>
            <li>Talk to a lawyer if significant money is involved</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is. Legitimate roofing contractors don't pressure, don't demand huge upfront payments, don't skip permits, and don't make offers that sound too good to be true.</p>

        <p>Take your time. Do your homework. A good roof is worth the effort to find a good contractor.</p>
